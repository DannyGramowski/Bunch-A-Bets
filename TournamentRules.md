## Tournament Structure

The tournament will be broken up into 2 stages: preliminaries, and finals.

### Preliminaries

Games will be pulled from the pool bots favoring those that have played the least. Games will be with 6 bots and go for 6 hands so every bot plays in every spot of the rotation. Premliminaries will be made up of 15 games or until there are 6 players remaining. If there is more than 6 bots after 15 rounds, the top 6 pots will advance to the finals. Bots keep their pots between games.

### Finals

 The 6 bots with the highest pot value after 15 games will advance to finals. Finals will involve 24 hands or until 1 player is left. Everyone will have a $5 pot when then enter finals regardless of their final score from prelims. Placements will be determined by when bots are eliminated i.e. 4th both whose pot goes to 0, will receive 4th place. If there is more than 1 bot remaining after 24 hands, ties will be decided by pot size.

The spirit of this friendly competition is to write your own algorithm for playing poker. We ask that you play to all the rules listed below, and don’t try to find loopholes or ways to get around the stated rules just to make the best bot. Remember to have fun! The stakes aren’t that high, and poker is an inherently random game, so you’ll never know what will happen.
