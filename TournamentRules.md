The spirit of this friendly competition is to write your own algorithm for playing poker. We ask that you play to all the rules listed below, and don’t try to find loopholes or ways to get around the stated rules just to make the best bot. Remember to have fun! The stakes aren’t that high, and poker is an inherently random game, so you’ll never know what will happen.
