## Rules
Everyone is dealt 2 cards that they use in combination with the 5 community cards to make the best 5 card hand.

### Rounds

1. Preflop: This is immediately after everyone has received their cards and before any community cards are shown. The Last player in the order receives the big blind and must bet at least 10 cents, and the second to last receives the small blind and must bet at least 5 cents.
2. Flop: 3 Cards are shown
3. Turn: 1 additional card is shown
4. River: 1 additional card is shown
5. Showdown: No betting happens here. This is where people compare hands to determine a winner

### Potential actions

Every round you have 3 options available to you:
1. Call: This means you bet up to the current highest bet. If you have already bet equal to the highest bet nothing happens.
2. Raise: You bet higher than the current highest bet. Everyone else that has already either called or raised is now back in the bidding order and must perform an action in response to your raise.
3. Fold: Throw your hand into the center. You are no longer part of the bidding round and you forfeit any money you have bet this hand.

#### All in

If you call and the highest pot is greater than what you have you are considered all in. Alternatively you can raise to your pot which would have the same effect. You are no longer in the bidding order. In the showdown you can only win an amount from each player equal to your total bet. All remaining money gets distributed to the 2nd place.

### Hand Rankings

If bots have the same type of hand, ties are broken by the high card. For straights and flushes this means the highest value card. For One or Two pair it will be the highest unshared card. If the hands are identical, the pot is split between the 2 players

1. Royal Flush
2. Straight Flush
3. Four of a Kind
4. Full House
5. Flush
6. Straight
7. Three of a Kind
8. Two Pair
9. One Pair
10. High Card
